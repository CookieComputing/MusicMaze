# MusicMaze

Hello there! As you might have guessed, this project involves mazes and somehow involves 
music ... of some sort? This is actually a birthday present of mine that I plan on giving a
friend before his birthday approaches.

## What is the MusicMaze?
The idea behind this project is to play a simple maze game, but with a nice caveat to the
idea: There is only one path to the correct destination, and by following along the
"correct" path, you will hear notes that correspond to a specific melody desired, and it
should be played in tune! Otherwise, you're probably on the wrong path.

### What is the expected date of project completion?
Well, I have to get it done *at some point*, but likely before my friend's birthday.

### Is there anything I should know?
Yes! I'm actually using this project for various purposes, one of which is to learn to
use PyCharm's various features and to finally transition from a purely text-editor based
development environment to an IDE with Vim-like support. I was really tired of running 
unit tests using the commandline so I wanted to try something new. If all goes well, PyCharm
could very well be my new favorite tool of choice!

I'm also using this project to reinforce some high level architecture design using the MVC 
pattern I learned from classes. I hope that this project can reveal some insights into areas
that I am lacking in expertise.

I also might consider adding Travis support just for the heck of it. I've never used
Travis as a CI tool, and maybe it might be fun to learn about it! That is, if I can figure out
how to use it effectively for this tiny project.
